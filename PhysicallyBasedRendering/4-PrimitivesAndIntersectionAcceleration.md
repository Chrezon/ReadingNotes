# Introduction:
How do we describe s**shapes** in a **scene**? -> **Primitives**
- **Geometric Primitive:** shapes that are rendered directly
	- Shape + appearance properties (Material)
- **Transformed Primitive:** Shapes with animated transformation matrices and object instancing (many instances of the same object at different locations)
	- Inject additional transformation matrix between shape's world space and actual world space

**Aggregate Class:** container that can hold many primitives -> acceleration structures
