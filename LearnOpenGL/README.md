# Learn OpenGL
These are my notes from reading and working through the website [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/). As this is a learning project, I'll be following the OpenGL 3.3 specifications (same as site), unless I find something particularly useful in newer OpenGL specifications. 

I am also following the page's implementations. This repo can be found at [OpenGLRasterizer](https://github.com/Chrezon/OpenGLRasterizer)
